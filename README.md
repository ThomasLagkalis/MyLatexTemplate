# Latex templates

Latex templates I currently use for academic purposes. The repo contains two templates:

- [Long Paper](https://github.com/ThomasLagkalis/MyLatexTemplate/tree/main/long_paper): For longer reports/writtings, contains table of contents, single page cover.

Also the sections and images are listed hierarchically in differents files and folders as shown bellow.

- [Short Paper](https://github.com/ThomasLagkalis/MyLatexTemplate/tree/main/short_paper): For shorter reports/writtings, simple but elegant.
